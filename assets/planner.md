# Day_Planner

![screenshot of complete day planner](./assets/ss1.png)

Created a 9AM-5PM work day scheduler, that allows user
to input their plans for the day by the hour.
The user is able to input their plans and have it save to local storage. 
The planner is color coded; 
    grey = past
    red = present
    green = future

    This planner was made to help user keep up with their tasks for the day. 

    Used jQuery and bootstrap to help create this project.
